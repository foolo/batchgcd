# `(C++)+GMP` BatchGCD algorithm

## Description

(C++)+GMP implementation of the [Batch GCD
algorithm](http://facthacks.cr.yp.to/batchgcd.html), by [Daniel
Bernstein](https://cr.yp.to/djb.html). This algorithm, described in [How To
Find Smooth Parts Of
Integers](https://cr.yp.to/factorization/smoothparts-20040510.pdf), allows to
compute pairwise GCDs of a list of integers in quasilinear time and memory. See
e.g. [factorable.net](https://factorable.net), which also provides source code.

## Updated patch for GMP binary I/O

For large datasets (~ 8M 2048-bit moduli), current `gmp` won't swap some
intermediate values correctly. The reason is an undocumented raw binary I/O
limit of `2**31` bytes.

The implementation of [factorable.net](https://factorable.net) patched this for
`gmp-5.0.5`, and we provide a similar patch for the current latest
(`gmp-6.1.2`), which is a more optimized and C++ friendly version.

Both `mpz_inp_raw` and `mpz_out_raw` are modified with the patch to admit
integers up to `2**63` bytes; consequently, this **breaks compatibility** with
regular `gmp` binary files.

_Note that `mpz_inp_raw` and `mpz_out_raw` have changed since `gmp-5.0.5`,
which makes the [factorable.net](https://factorable.net) patch incompatible
with current versions of `gmp`, hence the update._

Using the current `gmp` and the updated patch, this implementation is slightly
faster than the one given in [factorable.net](https://factorable.net). Please,
**do not rely on the patched library** for other purposes. The install script,
which is an updated version of the [factorable.net](https://factorable.net)
script, downloads `gmp-6.1.2`, applies the patch, and builds from source.

This patch has **not** been tested in 32-bit systems.

## Usage

These instructions have been tested **only in `Ubuntu 18.04, 19.04` and `Debian
GNU/Linux 9.9 (stretch)`**.

### Requirements

You need `g++, curl, m4, gmp, boost::thread` installed:
```
apt-get install curl m4 libgmp3-dev libboost-thread-dev
```

`curl` is only needed to download `gmp-6.1.2`. You can drop this requirement
and download it manually. The `sha1` fingerprint of the `.tar.bz2` will be
checked anyway (see `gmp_patch.sh`):

```
366ded6a44cd108ba6b3f5b9a252eab3f3a95cdf
```

### Input file

You need a csv file, containing integers in the following format
```
<ID>,<modulus in base 16>\n
```
You can also use
```
<ID>,<modulus in base 10>\n
```
and set the `-base10` option when running.

### Install

Clone and `cd` to the repo. Run
```
make install
```
The following script will download `gmp-6.1.2`, check the `sha1` fingerprint,
and apply our updated patch.
```
./patch_gmp.sh
```

Compile with
```make batchgcd```
and **after reading the disclaimer below**, run with
```
./batchgcd <path to your target csv file> [-base10]
```
Without the `-base10` option, the default is base 16. Results **contain no
factors** (this is made on purpose, see the disclaimer below), and only IDs are
stored in `compromised.csv, duplicates.csv`.

If there are duplicates, you may want to filter them out *before* running the algorithm, since number sharing all of its factors may appear as duplicate without really being duplicate. For instance; if `n = pq, m = pr, h = qr` all of them will appear as duplicates, and more work is needed to factorise (of course, na√Øve pairwise GCDs will do).

## Disclaimer

Feel free to use, alter, or reproduce this implementation **AT
YOUR OWN RISK**.

This implementation uses the C++ wrapper around GMP arbitrary precision
library, since it needs to handle potentially huge numbers. It favors writing
intermediate variables to disk, so beware that, assuming that all `n` input
integers are of bit length `l`, it efficiently writes a total disk memory of
```M = l * n * log(n)``` bits. That's 10.7 GB of information if you're
targeting 2 million 2048-bit integers. Please **do the numbers** and use/modify
**AT YOUR OWN RISK**.

Suggestions/comments/questions are more than welcome.
